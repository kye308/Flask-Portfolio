Hello internet, it's been a while.
One year ago, I wandered away from home into my first job.
Much has changed since that moment, and I'd like to reflect on this time
over the next few days. It's been a great year.

I could say something cliche like "it's time for change", but that's already happened. Here's to a
2016 that holds a candle to my 2015.
