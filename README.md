This repo is a website template that includes a projects section and blog.

### How to test:
```
$ pip install Flask Flask-Markdown

$ python applications.py

$ open http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

It should look something like [this][1].


### What you need to do:
In order to populate the templates on your websites, you will need to fill out template files and
add two images.

1. Fill out info.py.
2. Place a resume into `static/assets/resume.pdf`.
3. Place a banner image in `static/images/banner.jpg`.
4. Place an icon image in `static/images/ico/favicon.ico`.
5. Comment out `application.debug = True` in `application.py`.
6. Deploy to the platform of your choice. We are ready for Elastic Beanstalk.

### Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk
Deploying in Elastic Beanstalk is a simple process you can learn more about [here][2]. I can't speak
for other operating systems, but this repo has been tested on OSX.
